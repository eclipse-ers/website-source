### Features for Educators

Choosing the right materials for your students can be an arduous task.
This is especially true when determining whether these learning materials are too difficult to read.
With *Readability Studio*, you can determine the reading level of your materials, as well as guidance to make them easier to read.

Tests are also available for determining which materials are a good fit for second-language students.
Dolch sight words and the McAlpine EFLAW&reg; test and provided for both young English and ESL (English as a Second Language) readers.
Likewise, the graphical test FRASE is available for assisting SSL (Spanish as a Second Language) readers.

The program provides a breakdown of Dolch words that you are using (and not using) in your materials. This enables writers to see how they can improve their practice materials. Likewise, educators can use this to determine which materials are appropriate for sight word practice."
